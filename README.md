# 📊 Hate Crimes in the United States  

<sub>✅ This project was developed as part of my Data Analysis coursework at Fontys ICT & Business in the second semester of the first year </sub>  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **Hate Crimes in the United States**, using data provided by the **Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)**. The main objective is to **gain insights into the distribution of hate crimes** and help inform government decisions regarding **resource allocation** and **awareness campaigns**.  

The analysis explores different **bias motivations**, offender demographics, crime trends, and regional patterns. The results are visualized in an **interactive dashboard**, allowing users to explore the data dynamically.
